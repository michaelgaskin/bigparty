# This is the beginning

Of the BIG Party. Everyone is invited.

The BIG Party exists to do what other political parties have failed to do: Make it possible to live comfortably on a single income, near work, with no threat of crime. We have to do this before we do any of the other important work that needs doing. 

# Our Big Ideas
